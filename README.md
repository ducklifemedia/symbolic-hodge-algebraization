## 🧠 Overview

This repository accompanies the research paper:

> **Symbolic Algebraization of Rational Hodge Classes via Iterative Lefschetz Operators**  
> A novel approach to the Hodge Conjecture through symbolic convergence dynamics, blending algebraic geometry, logic, and symbolic computation.

We introduce a symbolic operator \( \widehat{\mathcal{S}} := \Lambda \circ \Pi_{\text{prim}} \circ P_k \) that acts iteratively on rational cohomology classes \( \omega \in H^{2p}(X,\mathbb{Q}) \cap H^{p,p}(X) \) to suppress their transcendental part \( \phi \) and converge toward an algebraizable representative in \( \text{Im}(cl) \).

🔬 Implementation Notes

- All cohomology classes are represented as NumPy vectors in a fixed algebraic basis.
- The Lefschetz inverse operator \( \Lambda \) is applied via the inversion of a polarization matrix.
- If no polarization matrix is provided, the identity matrix is assumed.
- This approach simulates Lefschetz duality numerically and is compatible with symbolic extensions (e.g. SymPy).



- This implementation defines \( \widehat{\mathcal{S}} \) as a modular composition:
  1. Π_prim (primitive projection)
  2. P_k (algebraizing symbolic filter)
  3. Λ (Lefschetz inverse contraction)
- The class ω is assumed to be in vector form over a fixed algebraic basis.
- Polarization matrix determines the metric and primitivity structure.
- Symbolic generalizations can replace NumPy with SymPy where needed.


- The primitive projector removes the part of ω that lies in the image of the Lefschetz operator L.
- It uses a simplified orthogonal projection:
  $$ \omega_{\text{prim}} = \omega - \frac{\langle \omega, L\omega \rangle}{\|L\omega\|^2} \cdot L\omega $$
- This is a linear-algebraic approximation of Π_prim, assuming the basis is orthonormal or appropriately normalized.


- `plot_phi_decay()` visualizes the logarithmic decay of the transcendental component ϕₖ.
- `plot_projection_trajectory()` shows the symbolic trajectory of ωₖ under iteration, in 2D or 3D coordinates.
- These functions help interpret the symbolic convergence process as a geometric purification.


- `apply_algebraic_filter` is a symbolic approximation of a motivic projector.
- Acts as a smoothing operator: the higher the order, the more "algebraic" the class becomes.
- Not intended to replicate a specific algebraic cycle projection, but to simulate symbolic contraction.
